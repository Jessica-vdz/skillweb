                    <p>
                        Poetry is a very important thing for me. I can explane my feelings in a much better 
                        way. I feel like i get more calm with every poem and story that i write.

                    <h2 class="title"> Why is poetry so important to me?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Somethimes when i get overwelmd or when i get frustated i don't know what to do or what to say. 
                        Writing is an escape for me. It's an escape from my head. Because sometimes i feel like i'm inside 
                        an empty white room without doors and i keep walking in circles without a wayout. 
                        Poetry is my way out of the white empty room
